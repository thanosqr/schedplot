Very early stages of development

----------------- Compiling -----------------

Simply use make:all().

----------------- Basic Interface Functions -----------------

start(Fun) -> ok
start(Fun,Flags) -> ok
start(Fun,FolderName) -> ok
start(Fun,FolderName,Flags) -> ok

Types: 
	   Fun = {Module, Function, Args} | function()
	   FolderName = name()
	   Flags = [Flag]

qijap:start/3 will profile Fun and store the trace in FolderName.
if no FolderName is given, the default name will be used (qijap_profile)
if there is a directory with the same name traces will be stored in that directory (older traces will the default names will be overwritten).

Flags:
no_auto_stop
	the profiling will not stop when Fun returns but will continue untill qijap:stop/0 is called. note that the profiling will stop if stop/0 is called even if this flag wasnt used.

gc
	profile and display the garbage collection

trace_all
	every procedure on the node will be traced

start()->ok
starts running the profiler (no function is called)

stop()->ok
stops the profiling and ensures that the traces have been delivered.


analyze()->ok
analyze(FolderName)->ok

analyzes the traces stored in FolderName. if no name is given, the default name will be used.

view()->ok
view(FolderName)->ok

displays the analyzed trace. if no name is given, the default name will be used.


---------------- Scarlet Notes----------------

Anywhere in the traced program qijap:print(Text) may be called where Text is a string. This will place a red vertical line, with a label displaying Text, at the graph of the shceduler in which the process was running in when qijap:print/1 was called.

Note that the text of labels that are too close may overlap and the vertical line will hide part of the graph.

Warning: qijap:print/1 is not supposed to be used a lot of times; it is supposed to be the equivalent of printing messages during debugging. A lot of calls may consume a significant amount of memory, depending on the size of Text as well as slow down the viewing process.

----------------- Graph Keys -----------------

Left/right arrow keys to move left/right (50px)
Control left/right for 200px, alt left/right for 10px
Numpad -/+ or up/down to zoom out/in
Home to return to the first state (aprox. fit the screen)


----------------- Notes -----------------

Resizing the window or exiting and restarting might result in a grey window; click or move left/right to instantiate it (resizing the window is not suggested)

Monitor memory consumption; sometimes trace messages are produced faster than they can be stored.
